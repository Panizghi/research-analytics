## Research analytics 📊

The first tool developed by the project is a research analytics web app built with [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) in Python 🐍

### Package installation 🔽

If you wish to use the research analytics app on your machine (run it locally), you can simply clone this GitHub repository by running the following command in your terminal (command prompt):

`$ git clone https://github.com/jhupiterz/research-analytics`

### Run the app locally 💻

Once the repo is cloned, make sure to be in the right directory on your machine and run the following command:

`$python dashboard.py`

The Python file will open a local port in your default browser and you'll be able to use the app.
If not, simply copy and paste the link that popped in your terminal (should look like ~ http://127.0.0.1:8050/).

### App documentation

A full documentation of how to use the app is available [here](https://www.notion.so/jhupiterz/Research-Analytics-dda8cbc930db498ba054f7ec2bb57dcc).
